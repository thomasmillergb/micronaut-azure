https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/[Azure Key Vault] is a secure and convenient storage system for API keys, passwords and other sensitive data.
To add support for Azure Key Vault to an existing project, add the following dependency to your build.

dependency:io.microaut.azure:micronaut-azure-secret-manage:{version}[]

NOTE: Azure doesn't allow _ and . in name of the secrets so the secret with name SECRET-ONE can be resolved also with SECRET_ONE and SECRET.ONE
